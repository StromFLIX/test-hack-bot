# They Thought They Were Free: The Gradual Erosion of Freedom in Nazi Germany

> Source: https://press.uchicago.edu/Misc/Chicago/511928.html

This excerpt from Milton Mayer's work presents a German philologist's firsthand account of how Nazi totalitarianism took hold through gradual, imperceptible steps between 1933-1945. The scholar describes how the widening gap between government and people occurred through constant crises, bureaucratic demands, and the diversion of attention from fundamental issues. Each small measure seemed inconsequential or justifiable at the time, making it impossible to recognize the overall transformation until it was too late. The account emphasizes how educated people, overwhelmed by daily demands and isolated from dissent, failed to resist because each step seemed only slightly worse than the last, and the anticipated 'great shocking occasion' that would unite opposition never materialized.

The philologist invokes Pastor Niemöller's famous reflection about failing to act when others were attacked, illustrating how inaction compounds until resistance becomes impossible. By the time individuals recognized the complete transformation of their society into one ruled by hate and fear, they were already compromised. The narrative includes examples like a judge who agonized over acquitting an innocent Jewish man, knowing it meant certain death, and explains how the war made any form of dissent tantamount to treason, silencing even those who recognized what was happening.
