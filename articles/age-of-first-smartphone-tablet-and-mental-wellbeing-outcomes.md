This study from the Global Mind Project analyzes data from 27,969 young adults aged 18-24 across 27 countries to examine the relationship between age of first smartphone/tablet ownership and current mental wellbeing. The findings reveal that mental wellbeing consistently improves with older age of first device ownership, with particularly pronounced effects in females. Among females who received their first smartphone at age 6, 74% experienced mental health challenges compared to 46% at age 18. The study identifies the Social Self dimension—reflecting self-image, confidence, and social relationships—as the most significantly affected area. Problems with suicidal thoughts, aggression towards others, and sense of detachment from reality declined most steeply with later device acquisition. These trends persisted even among individuals with no childhood trauma or adversity, suggesting that early smartphone access independently impacts mental wellbeing. The research suggests that smartphones may displace critical face-to-face social interactions during development, potentially causing 1,000-2,000 hours per year of lost in-person social learning opportunities.

> The study is correlational and does not provide definitive proof of causation, though alternative explanations are discussed as unlikely
> The data comes from self-reported surveys which may be subject to recall bias
> The study is limited to internet-enabled, literate populations who chose to take an online assessment
> Regional data for South Asia had insufficient samples for ages under 12
> The rapidly evolving nature of technology and internet environments makes long-term experimental verification impractical
> Differences between smartphones and tablets are not examined separately
