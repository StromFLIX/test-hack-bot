This article critically examines Signal's 'Sealed Sender' feature, which promises to hide sender identity from Signal's servers. The author argues that while Sealed Sender provides one-way anonymity by hiding the sender's phone number, it becomes useless in two-way communications. Signal can still correlate conversations through IP addresses and automatic delivery receipts that cannot be disabled. The author contends that Signal's requirement for phone numbers (which are often tied to real identities) combined with visible IP addresses and mandatory delivery receipts means Signal can still determine who is talking to whom, despite the feature's privacy promises. The article concludes by recommending SimpleX as a more privacy-focused alternative that doesn't require phone numbers or email addresses, though it acknowledges SimpleX is still developing and has performance issues.

> The article presents a somewhat one-sided critique without acknowledging potential counterarguments or Signal's stated threat model
> The snail mail analogy oversimplifies some technical aspects of how Sealed Sender works
> The claim that Signal is 'totally useless' is hyperbolic - it does provide protection against some threat models, just not all
> The article doesn't discuss Signal's recent addition of usernames as an alternative to phone number sharing
> SimpleX's recommendation comes with acknowledged significant limitations (slow, unreliable message delivery, poor voice calls) that may make it impractical for many users
