This guide provides comprehensive best practices for building LLM-powered agents that can independently execute complex, multi-step workflows. It covers fundamental concepts including agent definitions, appropriate use cases, and core components (models, tools, and instructions). The document explores orchestration patterns ranging from single-agent systems to multi-agent architectures (manager and decentralized patterns), emphasizing an incremental approach starting simple and scaling as needed. It also addresses critical safety measures through layered guardrails including relevance classifiers, safety filters, PII protection, and human intervention mechanisms. The guide draws from numerous customer deployments to offer practical, actionable frameworks for product and engineering teams building their first agents.
