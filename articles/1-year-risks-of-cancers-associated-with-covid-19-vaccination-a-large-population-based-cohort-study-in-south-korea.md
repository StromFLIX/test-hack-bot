This large-scale retrospective study analyzed data from 8,407,849 individuals in Seoul, South Korea between 2021-2023 to assess cancer risks following COVID-19 vaccination. Using propensity score matching and multivariable Cox proportional hazards models, researchers found statistically significant increased risks at 1 year post-vaccination for six cancer types: thyroid (HR 1.35), gastric (HR 1.34), colorectal (HR 1.28), lung (HR 1.53), breast (HR 1.20), and prostate (HR 1.69) cancers. Risk patterns varied by vaccine type (cDNA, mRNA, or heterologous), sex, and age group. The younger population (under 65 years) showed higher vulnerability to thyroid and breast cancers, while older individuals (75+) were more susceptible to prostate cancer. Booster doses were particularly associated with increased gastric and pancreatic cancer risks. The authors emphasize these are epidemiological associations and call for further research to determine causal relationships and optimal vaccination strategies.

> The study establishes epidemiological associations but does not prove causation between COVID-19 vaccination and cancer development
> The relatively short follow-up period of 1 year may be insufficient to capture cancer development, which typically requires longer latency periods
> Potential confounding factors not fully controlled in observational study design could influence results
> The study does not provide mechanistic evidence to explain how vaccines might influence cancer development
> Selection bias may exist despite propensity score matching, as unvaccinated individuals may differ systematically from vaccinated ones in ways not captured by available variables
> The biological plausibility of vaccines causing cancer within 1 year is questionable given typical cancer development timelines
