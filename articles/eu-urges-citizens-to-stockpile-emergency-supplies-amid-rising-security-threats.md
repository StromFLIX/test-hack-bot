The European Union has called on its 450 million citizens to maintain at least 72 hours worth of emergency supplies including food, water, medicine, and other essentials in response to increasing threats from war, cyberattacks, climate change, and disease. The announcement comes as the EU reassesses its security strategy, particularly following pressure from the Trump administration for Europe to take greater responsibility for its own defense. EU Preparedness and Crisis Management Commissioner Hadja Lahbib emphasized that modern threats are more complex and interconnected than ever, citing recent challenges including COVID-19 and Russian aggression, with NATO warning that Russia could be capable of launching another European attack by 2030.

The EU plans to establish strategic reserves of critical resources including firefighting planes, medical equipment, and assets to counter chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear threats. While similar measures have already been implemented in countries like France, Finland, and Sweden, the commission notes that preparedness levels vary across member states and is pushing for better coordination. The initiative aims to move away from ad hoc crisis responses toward more systematic emergency planning.
