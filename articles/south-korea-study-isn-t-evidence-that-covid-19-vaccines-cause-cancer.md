# South Korea study isn't evidence that COVID-19 vaccines cause cancer

A South Korea study examining health insurance data from over 8 million people claimed to find an association between COVID-19 vaccination and increased cancer risk. However, the study contains significant methodological flaws that undermine its validity. Major issues include immortal time bias (different enrollment criteria for vaccinated vs. unvaccinated groups that systematically undercounted cancer diagnoses in unvaccinated people), surveillance bias (unvaccinated people may seek medical care less frequently, leading to fewer detected cancers), and an extremely short follow-up period of only one year when most cancers take 5-10 years to develop. The study also lacks a credible biological mechanism explaining how vaccines could cause cancer, and epidemiological data from South Korea in 2021 showed no unusual increase in cancer incidence. Experts note that the study's findings showing elevated risk only in the first six months that then disappears is biologically improbable if vaccines truly caused cancer, and is more likely explained by detection bias and methodological problems.

> The study failed to correct for multiple comparisons despite conducting 30 statistical tests, significantly increasing the risk of false positive results
> The study assumes vaccinated and unvaccinated populations have similar health-seeking behavior without providing supporting data
> The journal added an editorial notice on October 22 citing concerns with the article raised to the editors
> The unvaccinated group comprised only 8% of the study population, making them statistical outliers unlikely to be comparable to the vaccinated group
